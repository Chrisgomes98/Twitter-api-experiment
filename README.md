# project-tags

This is a project to take the tweets and analize them in real time and plot their sentiment graph accordingly.
To analize the sentiments here I have used Vader Sentimment but TextBlob could also potentially be used, although it is slower than Vader sentiment.

PTBN
-plt.show() was not working for some reason thus I have made certain changes to the code to make it work.
-the code that i have written using dash is most probably depreciated and thus not working.
-the database has been created using SQlite3


Further Changes
-finding keywords
-finding the hashtags related to it
-finding their sentiments according
-plotting it
-autocommenting and auto liking bot for instagram
